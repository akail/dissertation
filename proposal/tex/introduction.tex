\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The \gls{srnl} \gls{atg} \cite{HomeATG} collects upwards of 60,000 weather records daily from 11 meteorological towers across the Central Savannah River Area over the last 50+ years. Currently, over 58 million of these have been manually labeled for anomalies by their meteorologists and technicians. This provides a unique data set in the Department of Energy and meteorological community. This data is used to feed real-time emergency response simulations, weather forecasts, and conduct climatological research. Current state-of-the-art meteorological Quality Assurance (QA) relies on statistical methods and rule-based heuristics for anomaly detection. This project proposes the development of ensemble methods utilizing deep learning to speed up and enhance the QA process for real time analysis.
