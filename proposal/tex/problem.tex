\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem}

This project will utilize existing \gls{srnl} \gls{atg} quality controlled meteorological data as a training, test and validation set to apply an ensemble of supervised and unsupervised deep learning to identify anomalous segments of data based on those previously identified.  Integration of theory guided constraints into the neural network will incorporate engineering controls, and domain knowledge into the optimization and cost functions during training.

Questions to be addressed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Can machine learning be effective in detecting anomalies in meteorological data?
    \item How can engineering requirements and theory be incorporated into the cost function of the neural network to enhance training time and accuracy.
    \item Which machine learning method or ensemble of methods is most effective in the context of multivariate time-series for segment classification
    \item Are there identifiable trends in the unique \gls{qa} process deployed by the \gls{atg}?
\end{itemize}
