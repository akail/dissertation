\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The \gls{srnl} \gls{atg} \cite{HomeATG} collects upwards of 60,000 weather records daily from 11 meteorological towers across the \gls{csra} over the last 50+ years. Currently, over 58 million of these have been manually labeled for anomalies by their meteorologists and technicians. This provides a unique data set in the \gls{doe} and meteorological community. This data is used to feed real-time emergency response simulations, weather forecasts, and conduct climatological research. Current state-of-the-art meteorological \gls{qa} relies on statistical methods and rule-based heuristics for anomaly detection. This project proposes the development of ensemble methods utilizing deep learning to speed up and enhance the \gls{qa} process for real time analysis.
